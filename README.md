### Animation Choices

The skeleton loader uses a shimmering effect to simulate content loading. Product cards enlarge and gain a shadow on hover to indicate interactivity. The "Add to Cart" button shrinks slightly on click to provide tactile feedback. The cart notification slides in and out smoothly to alert the user without being intrusive. These animations enhance user experience by making interactions feel more dynamic and responsive.
